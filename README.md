# shadcn-carousel
A carousel made exclusively from shadcn/ui components

Right now in this repo you can find a copy and paste of what I had in my project, I need to modify the files in order to create a little custom carousel with no db fetching of items.

This project makes use of the followings components:

Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTrigger, ScrollArea, ScrollBar, Button, SkeletonAnnounceCarousel

And I also used iconify for some icons.
